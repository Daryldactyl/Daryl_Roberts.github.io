üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I‚Äôm a dedicated Machine Learning Engineer with a rich and diverse background. My journey began in the world of operations, where I successfully led teams and managed complex data as an Operations Manager. My time as a Sergeant in the Marine Corps further honed my problem-solving abilities, communication skills, and adaptive thinking.

üî¨ Driven by a profound belief in AI's potential to revolutionize and enhance humanity, I decided to pivot my career towards Machine Learning. After graduating from LSU's AI/ML bootcamp powered by Fullstack Academy, I deepened my expertise with specialized courses in AI/ML, Google's TensorFlow certification, Computer Vision, Langchain, PyTorch, Git, and Environment-based Reinforcement Learning.

üìö I'm intrigued by interesting Machine Learning use cases like Biology üß¨, Healthcare ü©ª, Space ü™ê, and Physics üöÄ

ü•≥ When I'm not teaching computers how to take over the world: You can find me restaurant hopping for good food and drinks with my beautiful fiance, screaming at the refs during a 49ers game, reading a sci-fi/fantasy novel, or throwing the frisbee with my dog, "Anakin".

# Skills

## Data Acquisition: 
### Proficient in sourcing and collecting diverse datasets crucial for model training.
**Using**: *SQL queries, API utilization, Web scraping (Beautiful Soup and Requests), Stuctured and Unstructured data (csv, txt, pdf, etc), Build Langchain based AI assistant for additional data exploration.*

## Data Engineering: 
### Skilled in cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis and modeling. Additionally I have a keen eye for extracting meaningful features from existing data to feature engineer additional data insights to enhance model performance.
**Using**: *Pandas, Numpy, Tensorflow, Seaborn, Matplotlib*

## Model Building: 
### Capable of developing robust machine learning models tailored to specific tasks and objectives.
**Using**: *Tensorflow, Pytorch, Sci-kit Learn, Transfer Learning, Huggingface Hub, Implementation from research papers*

## Model Testing and Fine Tuning: 
### Thorough in evaluating model performance and iteratively refining for optimal results. Adept at optimizing model parameters for enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
**Using**: *Gridsearch/random search parameter tuning, Data Augmentation, Upsampling, Learning rate optimization, evaluation of training metrics loss/accuracy using graphs to identify bias.*

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
