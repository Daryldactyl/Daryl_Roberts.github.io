## Summary:
- **Developed an AI-powered Arxiv Research Assistant:**
  Leveraged advanced technologies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Langchain prompt chaining, and intelligent agents to find and summarize relevant research papers based on natural language queries.
- **Integrated OpenAI's GPT-3 for Natural Language Processing:**
  Utilized OpenAI's API for refining user queries, generating concise summaries, and making intelligent recommendations.
- **Implemented Iterative Document Processing and Retrieval:**
  Used PyPDFLoader for PDF processing and FAISS for efficient document similarity searches, ensuring high relevance in research paper retrieval.
- **Built Interactive Web Application:**
  Designed and deployed a Streamlit-based web application to provide an intuitive interface for researchers, enabling seamless interaction with the AI assistant.
